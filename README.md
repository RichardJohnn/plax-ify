plax-ify
================
here is a lame demo: http://richardjohnn.github.io/plax-ify/

from a tutorial at:
[guide to seed-element](http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/reusableelements.html)

this code assumes you have polymer in a folder one up from this repo to run, like the guide to seed-element has
